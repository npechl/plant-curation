# 📖 How to Download Plant ITS (or any other marker) Reference Barcodes from BOLD (Portal API)

This guide shows how to fetch **ITS sequences of Plantae** using the **BOLD Portal API** in four clear steps.

---

## 🔹 Step 1. Preprocess the query

Validate that your query is well-formed and recognized by BOLD.

```bash
https://portal.boldsystems.org/api/query/preprocessor?query=tax:Plantae
```

👉 You’ll see JSON confirming the query is valid.  
*(Here we target all plants; you can later filter markers like ITS.)*

---

## 🔹 Step 2. Preview the dataset (optional but recommended)

Get a quick **summary** of which markers are available and how many records exist for each.

```bash
https://portal.boldsystems.org/api/summary?query=tax:Plantae&fields=marker_code,specimens
```

👉 Look for `"ITS"` in the `marker_code` column to confirm ITS records are present.

---

## 🔹 Step 3. Request a query ID

Generate a `query_id` token (valid for ~24 hours) that represents your dataset.

```bash
https://portal.boldsystems.org/api/query?query=tax:Plantae&extent=full
```

👉 Copy the `query_id` value from the JSON response.  
*(Example: `"query_id":"2d3f4abc..."`)*

---

## 🔹 Step 4. Download the data

Use the `query_id` to download the full dataset in your preferred format (TSV is most convenient).

```bash
https://portal.boldsystems.org/api/documents/<query_id>/download?format=tsv
```

Replace `<query_id>` with the token from Step 3.  

👉 The TSV will contain **all markers** for Plantae.  

Filter locally (e.g., in Excel, R, or Python) to keep only rows where:

```
marker_code == "ITS"
```

# ✅ Summary

1. **Preprocess** → validate your query.  
2. **Summary** → preview marker availability.  
3. **Query** → get a token (`query_id`).  
4. **Download** → fetch the dataset and filter for ITS.  

This method is scalable, avoids broken queries, and works for any group/marker by just editing the query string.
